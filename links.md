> `https://thecelo.com/group/<domain>`<br/>
> https://thecelo.com/group/bi23

> `https://thecelo.com/group/<keybase name>`<br/>
> https://thecelo.com/group/sunxmldapp

> `https://thecelo.com/group/<address:0x000...>`<br/>
> https://thecelo.com/group/0x07fa1874ad4655AD0C763a7876503509be11e29E

> `https://thecelo.com/account/<address:0x000...>`<br/>
> https://thecelo.com/account/0x997490F08B9b99dB00657e2B1BbEc180Cf804A27
